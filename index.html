          <h2>The Schools need is a new age tool</h2>
          <p>
            Team SchoolerPro was born out of the desperation, doubt and anxiety
            that affected schools when COVID19 became a reality. But it is
            designed to outlast not only outlast the pandemic but also
            re-imagine pedagogy for the New Generation of Students. Indian
            Schools, though may face a lot of criticism for the means of
            imparting education, they still remain the powerhouse of educating
            so many students. At SchoolerPro, we believe that what the Schools
            need is a new age tool, that helps in managing content and making it
            seamlessly available for their students to consume. SchoolerPro is
            imagined as a platform that unites - Teacher, Students,
            Administrators, Third Party content creator with the sole aim of
            re-inventing a child’s education. All this without burning the
            pockets of parents in a pay-as-you-go model.

        <h2> Creating tomorrow's solutions for today </h2>
        <p>
          At SchoolerPro, we believe in creating tomorrow’s solutions for today.
          Education in India has always been a fast-paced industry where huge
          numbers are pitted against each other by institutions and upcoming
          EdTech Startups alike. We Beg to Differ. We are a platform that lets
          every teacher enhance her lesson and every student learn in a digital,
          real-world and scaleable way. Nature has already done a great job of
          already giving the kids a very plastic brain that just needs to be
          guided. We just have to keep feeding those guns and kids can imagine a
          world even better and smarter than us. Our logo emphasises our
          approach - Emphasise Application. Our logo is designed from a rather
          simple invention of a well known learned man. Pythagoras is so well
          known in India, thanks to his a^2 + b^2 = c^2 formula. In a poetically
          infamous way, this marks the single greatest rote-learned formula by
          many students in India. But Pythagoras is more than meets the eye. He
          loved the application of things with as much passion as he learned
          them. Our logo is based on a Pythagoras Cup. When filled under a
          certain level, the glass will hold its contents. Get greedy and fill
          more, it will empty everything with a vengeance, there is nothing one
          can do. Now, that is an application and that is why we love it - A
          fun, scientific toy that involves simple craftsmanship and takes a jab
          at a complex social problem of greed. That is high art. Which is what
          we want to be in the field of education.
