          <p>
            Team SchoolerPro was born out of the desperation, doubt and anxiety
            that affected schools when COVID19 became a reality. But it is
            designed to outlast not only outlast the pandemic but also
            re-imagine pedagogy for the New Generation of Students. Indian
            Schools, though may face a lot of criticism for the means of
            imparting education, they still remain the powerhouse of educating
            so many students. At SchoolerPro, we believe that what the Schools
            need is a new age tool, that helps in managing content and making it
            seamlessly available for their students to consume. SchoolerPro is
            imagined as a platform that unites - Teacher, Students,
            Administrators, Third Party content creator with the sole aim of
            re-inventing a childâ€™s education. All this without burning the
            pockets of parents in a pay-as-you-go model.
